When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    to push from local: 
    git remote :to create a remote
    git remote add <name of commit> (origin if only have one remote its standards to name it origin) URL of my remote from the gitHub : to add a remote
    git remote: to check if my remote has been added successfuly
    git remote -v: to check if the rURL was added cprrectly 
    git push origin master 


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because then I am certain the update has been done and i can check on my computer.

    git pull destination (origin) specify the branche the pullis coming from(master)

    git pull origin master
    

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks: copy commits from gitHub to GitHub 
    Best practice is to fork then clone then remote with new name. The commits are yours. You can update and experiment asmuch as you want to.

    >>>> Click on fork in gitHub and name the commits.

    Clones: get commits from GitHub to Computers.

    git clone URL from GitHub (Always put in version-control)

    Branches: determination of lost and captured commits
